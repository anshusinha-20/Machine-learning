### Model Training and Evaluation

The SVR model is trained on the entire dataset after scaling the features and target values using the StandardScaler from Scikit-learn. The SVR model is fitted to the scaled data using the fit method.

Predictions are made using the trained model on new input values. The input values are transformed using the scaler, then passed to the predict method of the SVR model. The predictions are inverse transformed using the scaler to obtain the predicted values in their original scale.

The results are visualized using scatter plots and line plots. The scatter plot shows the original data points, while the line plot represents the SVR model's predictions.
