### Dataset

The notebook uses the "Position_Salaries.csv" dataset, which contains information about different job positions and their corresponding salaries. The dataset is loaded using the pandas library and split into input features (X) and target values (Y).

### Model Training and Evaluation

The SVR model is trained on the entire dataset after scaling the features and target values using the StandardScaler from Scikit-learn. The SVR model is fitted to the scaled data using the fit method.

Predictions are made using the trained model on new input values. The input values are transformed using the scaler, then passed to the predict method of the SVR model. The predictions are inverse transformed using the scaler to obtain the predicted values in their original scale.

The results are visualized using scatter plots and line plots. The scatter plot shows the original data points, while the line plot represents the SVR model's predictions.

## ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (Decision_tree_regression.ipynb) that demonstrates how to perform decision tree regression using the scikit-learn library in Python.

### Description

Decision tree regression is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by partitioning the input space into regions and predicting the target variable based on the average value of the training examples in each region. This approach creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.

In this notebook, we will use decision tree regression to predict salaries based on position levels. The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided in the file Position_Salaries.csv.

### Usage

To run this notebook, follow these steps:
